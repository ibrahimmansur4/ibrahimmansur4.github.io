        <h3>Robotisim, Summer Intern</h3>
        <p>
            Worked in a team on multiple projects which included programming mobile robots,
            ESP32 cam for security wifi, and implementing microROS on ESP32.
            We used GitHub and VsCode for a smooth coding experience. We used Linux Ubuntu as
            our OS as it is the defacto for robotic applications. (07/2023 – 09/2023)

            I was placed in the P&I section (Protection and Instrumentation).
            This section was responsible for the installation of sensors, taking regular readings from
            PLCs in the control units of different machinery, etc. The SCADA (Supervisory Control &
            Data Acquisition) system was the main control system for the power plant. I learned how
            it was implemented and how it worked. (06/2023 – 07/2023)
